# Console Recorder Extension

### Description :

This extension enables developers to display their logs/messages directly in the UI, eliminating the need to access the browser's DevTools.
The aim of this tool, which is rudimentary at the moment, is to simplify client script debugging. 
There are several potential implementations for this project, and contributions are highly welcome. :) 

### Features :

- [x] : Capture console messages: log, error, warn, info, debug.
- [] : Filtering Messages by Type, and allow user to display them or not
- [] : Allowing users to choose whether or not to display stack traces with error messages 

### Installation :

- Download and extract the extension source code.
- Open Google Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/.
- Activate "Developer Mode" in the top right-hand corner.
- Click on "Load unpackaged extension" and select the extension folder.
